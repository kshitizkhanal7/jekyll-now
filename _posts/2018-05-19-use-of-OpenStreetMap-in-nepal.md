OpenStreetMap has been used in many ways in Nepal. Some of them are listed below:
1. For navigation
Probably the way most people use OSM is for navigation. OSM based MAPS.ME is popular in Nepal for accessing offline maps since mobile data is expensive in Nepal. A large proportion of people who use MAPS.ME are not aware it's OSM, or may not have even heard of OSM at all.  

2. Local governance
3. Disaster 
4. Engaging youth
