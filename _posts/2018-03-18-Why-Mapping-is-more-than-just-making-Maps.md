"Map is the mirror of society." 
As a part of my job at Kathmandu Living Labs, I use this sentence quite often. No one has ever disagreed. I have also heard of other mirrors of society like literature and cinema. All these portray something about a society. The image of a society is created in films and literature as a projection of the creator's understanding. Digital maps like OpenStreetMap, although they are made of up points, lines and polygons, are also subject to the mapmaker's projection.  




As a result of my work at KLL, reflections on my experiences, and conversations with Chip that acted as a trigger for me to write this post.
