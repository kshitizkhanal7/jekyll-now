Argument Structure:
Topic: I am studying mapping as something more than just making maps
Conceptual question: Because I want to find out if, and in what ways mapping can help develop a mapper in more ways than one 
Conceptual significance: In order to help my reader understand that the exercise of mapping can be used as a tool to develop civic sense, leadership and more    
Practical application: In order to help my reader design programs to develop civic sense, mapping

The questions asked by Harold Rugg
"Out of an enormously long list of location facts that compose a complicated world order, which ones are for universal, frequent and necessary utility to the great masses of our people? Specifically, what is the relative order of their importance?" (Harold Rugg, Objective Studies in Map Location)

"The universe is fluid and fluent; its contents dissolve and re-form with amazing rapidity. But, after all, it is the child's own world. It has the uniqueness and completeness of his own life. He goes to school, and various studies divide and fractionize the world for him. Geography selects, it abstracts, and analyzes one set of facts, and from one particular view." John Dewey, The Child and the Curriculum.

Dewey's definition of a map: (a map, after all, is a logical ordering of elements from psychological experiences of one or more explorers as they wander through unknown terrain) in John Dewey's The Child and the Curriculum: A Century Later Author(s): D. C. Phillips

Mapping is not a technical activity, it is socio-technical.
