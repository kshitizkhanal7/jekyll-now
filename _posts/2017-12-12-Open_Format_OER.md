title: Open File Formats for Open Educational Resources
---

Users of Open Educational Resources (OERs) should be able to Retain, Reuse, Revise, Remix and Redistribute. As Clint Lalonde mentions in
his [post](http://clintlalonde.net/2013/06/25/pdf-is-where-oers-go-to-die/#sthash.nrPr2MOD.dpuf), most OERs are released in PDF. PDF is 
a popular file format, no doubt, but releasing OERs in PDF format kills the spirit of open. 


PDF cannot be easily edited, so Revise and Remix go out of the window. 


So, what are the alternates? 
I can think of few. 
.odt, markups, LATEX.
