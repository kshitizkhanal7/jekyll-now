title: Starting conceptual article on Open Science Education with Household Stuff 
---

Today, I am starting to write a paper on Open Science Education using household stuff. 

Project: [https://github.com/kshitizkhanal7/Aerogami](https://github.com/kshitizkhanal7/Aerogami)
Paper in progress on [Google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JbhDASOAITqJLK6ad018_3v7J6JQjqqsLSDWkrhe13w/edit#)

What will the paper discuss: 
- Open Educational Resources and Open Educational Practice
- Gaps in how science is taught
- How could those gaps be addressed
- Using household stuff to teach science
- Developing a model to create OER for teaching science
- Next steps for the project (testing out the model and updating)

I want to document the process as I go through with it through this blog. 

Let the adventure begin!
