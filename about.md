I am an open knowledge hackticist. I love to build things, write, and play with paper. I care about open knowledge and sustainability above most else. 

I am currently the Chairperson at [Open Knowledge Nepal](http://oknp.org) and a researcher at (Kathmandu Living Labs)[http://kathmandulivinglabs.org].
