I currently work at the intersection of energy planning and geospatial data science. I believe that a more open world, with increased open access to knowledge, software, hardware and more is a better world.

I am currently the Chairperson at [Open Knowledge Nepal](http://oknp.org) and a PhD student at the Department of City and Regional Planning at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Previously, I have worked as a researcher at [Kathmandu Living Labs](http://kathmandulivinglabs.org) and a mechanical design consultant for [ABARI](http://abari.earth).
